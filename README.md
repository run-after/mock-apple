Taken from The Odin Project - (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients)

In this project, I cemented my ability to move objects around the page and used gradients for the nav bar.

I didn't worry about linking around to the different pages, I just focused on the layout.

This was a pretty straight forward process.

Here is the original page I was mocking - (https://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/)
